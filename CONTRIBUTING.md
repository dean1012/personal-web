## Push Confirmation Hook

Pushing to `dev` publishes to the development website, and promoting to `main`
publishes to production. Install the provided pre-push hook to require
interactive confirmation before every push. The hook warns that pushing may
publish website changes and requires typing `publish` to continue:

```bash
mkdir -p .githooks
cp templates/pre-push .githooks/pre-push
chmod 0755 .githooks/pre-push
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Validation

Run the same validation commands used by CI:

```bash
python3 -m json.tool .vscode/extensions.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool .vscode/settings.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool .htmlvalidate.json >/dev/null
./node_modules/.bin/eslint --config eslint.config.mjs \
  eslint.config.mjs \
  stylelint.config.cjs
find site/frontend -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.html' -print0 \
  | xargs -0 -r ./node_modules/.bin/html-validate --config .htmlvalidate.json
git ls-files '*.yml' '*.yaml' | xargs -r yamllint
git ls-files '*.md' | xargs -r markdownlint-cli2
```

If the repository uses a `css/` directory, lint all CSS files with this command:

```bash
find site/frontend/css -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.css' -print0 \
  | xargs -0 -r ./node_modules/.bin/stylelint --config stylelint.config.cjs
```

If the repository uses a `js/` directory, lint all JavaScript files with this
command:

```bash
find site/frontend/js -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.js' -print0 \
  | xargs -0 -r ./node_modules/.bin/eslint --config eslint.config.mjs
```

After changing validation configuration files, restart the relevant VS Code
language server so editor diagnostics use the updated rules.
The Stylelint language server may occasionally display stale diagnostics after
files are moved, removed, or corrected. Restarting the Stylelint server clears
those stale errors.

Before committing changes, also check the current diff for whitespace errors:

```bash
git diff --check
```

## Pull Requests

Use GitHub issues to track meaningful changes.

Create a focused feature branch and open a pull request into `dev`. Changes are
not deployed to the development website until they are merged into `dev`.

Reference the related issue in each commit and include
`Closes #<issue-number>` in the pull request description when the pull request
should close an issue after merging.

Sign each commit so GitHub can verify its authorship. The `main` and `dev`
branch rulesets require signed commits before merging:

```bash
git commit -S -m "<message> (Refs #<issue-number>)"
```

All changes target `dev` before production. Production promotion is handled
through a pull request from `dev` to `main` after development review.

CI runs on pushes, pull requests, and manual workflow dispatches. Pull requests
are squash merged after CI passes and review conversations are resolved.

## Production Promotion

After a `dev` to `main` pull request is squash merged, the repository
maintainer should merge `main` back into `dev` locally so future production
promotion pull requests contain only new changes:

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch dev
git pull --ff-only origin dev
git merge --no-ff -S origin/main -m "Merge main back into dev"
git push origin dev
```

If the pre-push hook prompts for confirmation, type `publish`.

## Website Style Guidelines

Follow the established visual and editorial style already present in this
repository. New colors, typography, logo treatments, layout patterns, or voice
changes should fit the existing site and may be adjusted during review for
style consistency.

HTML should be semantic, accessible, and valid. Prefer meaningful landmarks,
headings, links, buttons, labels, and alternative text instead of presentational
markup.

CSS should be organized for maintainability, use clear class names, avoid
unnecessary specificity, and keep responsive behavior explicit. Prefer custom
properties for repeated design tokens.

JavaScript should be minimal, readable, and progressive. Avoid global side
effects unless the page behavior requires them, and keep DOM interactions small
enough to review easily.

## Deployment Cues

Development deployments receive small server-side visual cues during
deployment. The deployment process appends a space followed by `[Dev]` to the
page title and injects a `Development Environment` footer into development
site output.

Do not create, modify, or use the `dev-footer` CSS class. On development
deployments, the injected `.dev-footer` will appear at the very bottom of the
website after any included footers and content.

## Documentation Guidelines

Keep public behavior documented in `README.md` and contributor workflows
documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Add comments for non-obvious implementation
decisions, security boundaries, accessibility considerations, and assumptions.
Avoid comments that merely restate straightforward markup, styles, or scripts.
